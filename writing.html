		<p><b>Riccardo</b>
		<p>There is only one thing in the world that Riccardo Tenepri cares unconditionally for and that is his little brother, Erik. Their home is not one of love and affection, however, and he watches daily as his brother is shaped as he was to be a cold and deadly soldier by their father. He wishes only for the opportunity to get Erik to safety and out of their father's reach. So, when he is gifted a fae for his 50th birthday and his dearest friend, Dr. Seavers, asks for his help to get the fae back home, he sees his opportunity to save Erik as well. 
		<p>
		<p><b>Leon</b>
		<p>Leonardo Dupont is one of the last remaining fae in the world. After having separated from his host to do some traveling, he is finally ready to return home. The sweet family reunion he imagined is not meant to be, however, and he finds himself kidnapped by vampires who promptly set him before their gloomy-looking prince. When the prince bites him in front of a party full of other vampires, he swears he'll hate him until his very last breath. When it turns out the prince might be the only chance he has to get home, however, he realizes he's going to have to set his grudge aside, and accept his help. 
		<p>
		<p><b>Arthur</b>
		<p>Arthur Seavers has been the royal physician for the last century, and has watched King Demetri Tenepri commit atrocity after atrocity. Worst of all, is the way he treats his sons whom Arthur has developed a strong fondness for. When a fae is gifted to Prince Riccardo, Arthur can not bare the thought of seeing one of the 'people of light' be crushed with despair under King Demetri's rule. He puts his foot down, finally, and hatches a plan to get the princes and the fae to safety.</p>
